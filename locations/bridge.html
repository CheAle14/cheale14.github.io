            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>
                The bridge, opened 30th June 1984, is a bascule and suspension bridge. This means the road portion may be raised by use of a counterweight to allow taller boats to pass underneath<br/>
                The bridge is often called "London Bridge", however London Bridge refers to various bridges that have spanned the Thames between the <em><abbr title="Not to be confused with London.">City of London</abbr></em> and Southwark.
